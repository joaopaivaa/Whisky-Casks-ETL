ABOUT ADNAMS Adnams has been brewing in Southwold since 1872. A passion for quality and innovation pervades and countless awards and medals have been won since the company was founded. World-class brewing equipment and the highest quality, local raw materials are combined to produce great beers and that same passion for producing the very best quality is now applied to the spirits distilled in the Copper House Distillery. Copper House Distillery is located at the historic Adnams Brewery in Southwold, Suffolk, on the east coast of England. It is one of the most water and energy-efficient distilleries in the UK and also generates water and steam for the brewery, which is an integral part of the sustainable production system. Adnams was the first brewery/distillery in England to produce spirits completely from malting the barley to the finished product. The same local ingredients are used for the spirits as with the beers. The distillery has created whisky using various combinations of barley, rye, wheat and oats."

ABOUT ADNAMS Adnams has been brewing in Southwold since 1872. A passion for quality and innovation pervades and countless awards and medals have been won since the company was founded. World-class brewing equipment and the highest quality, local raw materials are combined to produce great beers and that same passion for producing the very best quality is now applied to the spirits distilled in the Copper House Distillery. Copper House Distillery is located at the historic Adnams Brewery in Southwold, Suffolk, on the east coast of England. It is one of the most water and energy-efficient distilleries in the UK and also generates water and steam for the brewery, which is an integral part of the sustainable production system. Adnams was the first brewery/distillery in England to produce spirits completely from malting the barley to the finished product. The same local ingredients are used for the spirits as with the beers. The distillery has created whisky using various combinations of barley, rye, wheat and oats."

Tasting Notes from Adnams Distiller On the nose, you will find sherry-like flavours of sultanas and fruit peels, alongside an almond nuttiness, baking spices and fresh herbal notes. The palate is rich and sweet with a full body and flavours of cinnamon, nutmeg, toasted nuts, and hints of vanilla. Candied fruit and warm spices linger on the finish.

ABOUT ADNAMS Adnams has been brewing in Southwold since 1872. A passion for quality and innovation pervades and countless awards and medals have been won since the company was founded. World-class brewing equipment and the highest quality, local raw materials are combined to produce great beers and that same passion for producing the very best quality is now applied to the spirits distilled in the Copper House Distillery. Copper House Distillery is located at the historic Adnams Brewery in Southwold, Suffolk, on the east coast of England. It is one of the most water and energy-efficient distilleries in the UK and also generates water and steam for the brewery, which is an integral part of the sustainable production system. Adnams was the first brewery/distillery in England to produce spirits completely from malting the barley to the finished product. The same local ingredients are used for the spirits as with the beers. The distillery has created whisky using various combinations of barley, rye, wheat and oats."

Tasting Notes from Adnams Distiller On the nose, you will find sherry-like flavours of sultanas and fruit peels, alongside an almond nuttiness, baking spices and fresh herbal notes. The palate is rich and sweet with a full body and flavours of cinnamon, nutmeg, toasted nuts, and hints of vanilla. Candied fruit and warm spices linger on the finish.

ABOUT ADNAMS Adnams has been brewing in Southwold since 1872. A passion for quality and innovation pervades and countless awards and medals have been won since the company was founded. World-class brewing equipment and the highest quality, local raw materials are combined to produce great beers and that same passion for producing the very best quality is now applied to the spirits distilled in the Copper House Distillery. Copper House Distillery is located at the historic Adnams Brewery in Southwold, Suffolk, on the east coast of England. It is one of the most water and energy-efficient distilleries in the UK and also generates water and steam for the brewery, which is an integral part of the sustainable production system. Adnams was the first brewery/distillery in England to produce spirits completely from malting the barley to the finished product. The same local ingredients are used for the spirits as with the beers. The distillery has created whisky using various combinations of barley, rye, wheat and oats."

World-class brewing equipment and the highest quality, local raw materials are combined to produce great beers and that same passion for producing the very best quality is now applied to the spirits distilled in the Copper House Distillery. Copper House Distillery is located at the historic Adnams Brewery in Southwold, Suffolk, on the east coast of England. It is one of the most water and energy-efficient distilleries in the UK and also generates water and steam for the brewery, which is an integral part of the sustainable production system. Adnams was the first brewery/distillery in England to produce spirits completely from malting the barley to the finished product. The same local ingredients are used for the spirits as with the beers. The distillery has created whisky using various combinations of barley, rye, wheat and oats."

Tasting Notes from Adnams Distiller You will find indulgent aromas of toasted oak, bananas, and ripe blackberries on the nose. The palate is luxurious, with a brown sugar sweetness, butterscotch, and raisin fruit, balanced by cinnamon and a sprinkling of peppery spice. The finish is long with oaky notes of vanilla and cocoa, and those amazing blackberries again, at the end. ABOUT ADNAMS Adnams has been brewing in Southwold since 1872. A passion for quality and innovation pervades and countless awards and medals have been won since the company was founded. World-class brewing equipment and the highest quality, local raw materials are combined to produce great beers and that same passion for producing the very best quality is now applied to the spirits distilled in the Copper House Distillery. Copper House Distillery is located at the historic Adnams Brewery in Southwold, Suffolk, on the east coast of England. It is one of the most water and energy-efficient distilleries in the UK and also generates water and steam for the brewery, which is an integral part of the sustainable production system. Adnams was the first brewery/distillery in England to produce spirits completely from malting the barley to the finished product. The same local ingredients are used for the spirits as with the beers. The distillery has created whisky using various combinations of barley, rye, wheat and oats."

ABOUT ADNAMS Adnams has been brewing in Southwold since 1872. A passion for quality and innovation pervades and countless awards and medals have been won since the company was founded. World-class brewing equipment and the highest quality, local raw materials are combined to produce great beers and that same passion for producing the very best quality is now applied to the spirits distilled in the Copper House Distillery. Copper House Distillery is located at the historic Adnams Brewery in Southwold, Suffolk, on the east coast of England. It is one of the most water and energy-efficient distilleries in the UK and also generates water and steam for the brewery, which is an integral part of the sustainable production system. Adnams was the first brewery/distillery in England to produce spirits completely from malting the barley to the finished product. The same local ingredients are used for the spirits as with the beers. The distillery has created whisky using various combinations of barley, rye, wheat and oats."
