As another cask of Macallan in bond arrives for auction, it is worth remembering that this year the new Macallan distillery will open to the public. As full production commences at this new distillery the original Macallan distillery - where this very cask was distilled back in 1989 - will cease production. Leaving aside the arguments about the implications of this decision, the fact remains that this is a scarce opportunity to acquire a cask of Macallan from the original distillery - a liquid that some may come to consider increasingly historic and valuable in light of these aforementioned forthcoming developments. On top of this, this particular cask has spent its entire life maturing on site at the distillery. Something which adds that extra layer of history and romance to what is, most importantly, an excellent whisky in its own right. Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Colour: Gold Nose: This is a classical, aged Speyside profile with a forward note of honey, buttered toast, sweet and savoury patisserie, yellow flowers, pollen and various notes of toasted sunflower seeds, cereals, hay and, with a little opening up time, a rather beautiful and fragrant aroma of orange peel and citrus cake. Develops with white and green fruits and more citrus aspects. Palate: Surprisingly spicy. Spice cake, cinnamon buns, pumpernickel and rye breads, olive oil, a light mineral aspect and subtle earthiness. Develops towards quince, turmeric and this orangey note again, manifesting here as orange bitters and mulling spices. Finish: Long with drying earthiness, light waxes and more cereal and hay loft notes. Still slightly buttery in texture with some background green fruits. Comments: A perfect example of well-aged Macallan that displays the distillate weight and character extremely well without any undue or excess influence from the cask. This could be bottled now but it seems a shame not to allow it to reach 30 years. The freshness and the flavour profile are still perfectly vibrant and I see no reason why the cask could not be allowed to mature for anything up to a further five years.";NA;"Cask No: 1248";NA;"Distilled: 1989";"Age: 29 years old";"Cask Type: Refill Sherry Hogshead.";"Original Filled : Litres of Alcohol 166.20 @ 63.5%";"Original Bulk Litres 262 @ 63.5%";"Original Bulk Litres 262 @ 63.5%";"New re-gauged: 12/12/2017 - 95.10 litres of Alcohol";"New re-gauged 180 Bulk Litres";"Current Cask Strength: 52.75%"

Colour: Full Amber Nose: An immediate and beautifully earthy, nervous and resinous sherry. Surprisingly old style and reminiscent of some old Campbell Hope & King bottlings of Macallan with these bold notes of walnut wine, earthen floors, dunnage, many dark fruits such as dates, prune juice and sultanas along with rancio and pipe tobacco. Develops further tertiary notes of mint leaf, eucalyptus and camphor. Quite a remarkable nose! Palate: The sherry character still dominates, although the weightiness of the distillate still matches it well and there is wonderful balance between these notes of truffle, earth, fruit jams, molasses and black pepper. Quite stunning really. With time some flecks of green fruit, tree bark and hessian emerge. Finish: Long and very warm. A glow of dense, chocolatey sherry with dried herbs and morello cherries. Comments: A spectacular and delightfully old style Macallan. Reminiscent in some ways of some early 1970s Glendronach's. The sherry is clean but dense and earthy, although never too intense or overbearing on the spirit. This could easily be bottled now or be left for up to another five years.

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Macallan Cask #9313 Colour: Straw Nose: Light and very fresh. Cut grass, bailed hay, straw, citrus rind, peppery watercress and some light notes of shoe polish and new leather. Definitely towards the softer side of Macallan. With a little breathing time it begins to reveal herbal notes such as fresh oregano and rosemary. Also some earthier, rootier qualities and a sweetness that alludes to milk bottle sweets. Palate: Similarly soft, delicate and gentle. Lots of citrus oils, earthy turmeric, a gentle sunflower oil note and some supple mineral notes. Again these greener qualities come through as chopped parsley and chives, cut grass and a foresty bracken note. Some hints of pine resin, clove, more polish notes and a light green pepper aspect. Finish: Medium in length. A rising sootiness, more lemon aspects although this time manifesting in a more medicinal, cough syrupy fashion. These soft peppery qualities persist into the aftertaste giving a warming sensation. Comments: A cask which really shows the lighter side of Macallan. Could potentially last until 30 quite well, although probably not much beyond. At the moment the alcohol level gives good bite and mouthfeel which helps bolster the otherwise rather soft qualities of the distillate.";NA;"Cask No: 9313";"Distillery: Macallan";"Distilled: 1989";"Age: 29 years old";"Cask Type: Third Fill Hogshead.";"Original Filled: Litres of Alcohol 159.20 @ 63.50% Original Bulk Litres 250.70 @ 63.50%";"Original Filled: Litres of Alcohol 159.20 @ 63.50% Original Bulk Litres 250.70 @ 63.50%";"Original Filled: Litres of Alcohol 159.20 @ 63.50% Original Bulk Litres 250.70 @ 63.50%";"New re-gauged: 03/09/2018 - 74.90 litres of Alcohol";"New re-gauged: 149.70 Bulk Litres";"Current Cask Strength: 49.84%"

Colour: Light Amber Nose: Lighter, leafier and a little hotter than cask 2316. This is more towards green pepper, dried mushrooms, red fruits and notes of pollen, wild flowers, mead and dried herbs. More powerful and perhaps more singular than its sibling but not quite in the same old style vein. With time becomes more menthol and waxy giving way to some lovely green fruits. Palate: Juicy fruits in the form of fruit jams and cordials with some dark chocolate, mint choc chip ice cream and herbal liqueurs. Cocktail bitters, caraway, rosewater and beeswax all appear. It wears its high abv surprisingly well. There is an oiliness and more overt fruitiness that betrays the fact this one is more dominated by the distillate and the cask is slightly less active than 2316. A meatiness towards the finish like beef stock. Finish: Long with plenty of green fruit, wet leaves, cigar boxes, cured meats and peppery notes. Towards the end quite a distinctive note of orange bitters and orange peel emerges. Comments: Perhaps not as stellar as 2316 but this is still excellent Macallan. The freshness means it could easily stand further ageing for a number of years should the purchaser choose to keep it in bond for extended maturation.

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Macallan Cask #3480 Colour: White Wine Nose: Surprisingly, and rather thrillingly, quite fruity. There are these distinctly tropical aspects which nod towards these old Irish single malts from similar vintages. Lots of lemon, melon, ripe apple, gooseberry, banana and guava. An even mix of ripe green and tropical fruits that gives an abundance of freshness. There’s also raw malt, buttery cereals and barley water. A wonderful example of a naked and distillery character forward old Macallan. Palate: Cornflour, buttered toast and earthier, sootier qualities as well. Some hints of peppery watercress, ointment, sack cloth and lemon balm. Milk bottle sweeties, cornflakes and drier notes of crushed aspirin and menthol gum. Some dried herbs as well, bouquet garni, olive oil and a hint of angelic root. Light in texture but there’s still a firmness about it overall which is quite satisfying. Finish: Good length. Rather oily, buttery, cereal and lemony. Moving more towards a classical style Speyside. Comments: Ready for bottling now. More textbook on the palate but the nose is really terrific.

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Colour: Gold Nose: It’s a fresh and pretty classical, ‘naked’ style Macallan. Biscuit, varnished wood, a plush assortment of green fruits and even something tropical like a little passionfruit. Plenty typical notes of cereals, muesli – it’s quite savoury in fact – and a little green fruit compote. With water: becomes more mineral and gravelly. Notes of paprika and freshly ground white pepper. Again more very elegant tropical fruit notes linger in the back. Quite an intriguing nose for a Macallan – but the natural weight and heft of the distillate shines through well. Palate: A little hot on delivery but gives way nicely to tobacco leaf, gingerbread and muscovado sugar. Also some nice leathery notes follow along with a pleasant leafiness. I suspect this is a refill sherry hogshead. It’s also quite diverse from the nose but in a pleasantly surprising way, the sherry components were not so evident on the nose. With water: more spicy with water along with added notes of treacle, plum wine and a little camphor as well. Again quite sturdy, classical Macallan. Finish: Good length. Medium sweetness from the residual sherry influence along with some nutty and earthy notes which lift the whole thing nicely.

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Colour: Amber Nose: Pow! Now this is Macallan! Beautifully resinous, mineral and nervous sherry. Ridden with nuts, wet earth, wax jackets, dundee cake, treacle and various dark fruit compotes. A wonderful throwback to style of Macallan that’s long disappeared from most contemporary bottlings. It feels like you could be nosing an old Anniversary Malt from the early 2000s. Goes on with some green fruit, black pepper, a little graphite perhaps – some dried mushrooms. With water: broader and more earthy with a beautiful and gentle streak of something medicinal like gentian. Some green peppercorns, aged pinot noir and furniture oil. Quite complex and compelling. Palate: A wonderful continuation of the nose. Many dark fruits: dates, fig jam, damsons, sultanas and raisins stewed in cognac. Pepper, black tea, molasses, a touch of old rum and some old Vin Juane wine and walnut oil. Many classical flavours such as aged Balsamico and rancio all make appearances as well. With water: again its earthier and drier. The sherry is a little more ‘free and easy’ not quite as taught and nervous as to begin with. More notes of various red and dark fruit jams, some coal hearth notes and more chewy walnut notes. Finish: Long, earthy, nicely drying, herbal and with resurgent notes of old balsamico, camphor and a little rancio. Comments: An excellent and truly classical Macallan in the way the sherry and distillate integrate beautifully and with great deft and balance. This one you could bottle straight away or leave for perhaps another 2-3 years.

There are some notes of dried rosemary, motor oil, pistachio nuts and a background note of mint.

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Macallan Cask #4070 Colour: white Wine Nose: A soft buttery note to begin which unfolds nicely onto coal hearths, damp earth, linseed oil, furniture polish and delicate tertiary notes of coconut, lemon balm, dried herbs and cough medicine. There is a resilient cereal note running underneath as well; crisp, lean and malty. In time there's notes of dried banana chips, sunflower seeds and other trail mix qualities. The overall impression is one of a fine-textured, well-balanced malt whisky. Palate: Good weight and texture. Slightly petroly and oily with notes of grassy olive oil and mineral oil. Very light camphor and wax aspects as well. More well-structured cereal qualities, some natural sweetness and hints of various dried herbs. These ever so slight medical aspects resurge with these notes of cough medicine and orange throat sweets. Get's spicier over time as well, towards freshly ground white pepper and cinnamon bark. Finish: Long, spicy, dry, slightly mineral and with some unusual notes of steel wool, pine needles, wood resins and coal dust. Still rather precise and punchy. Comments: An excellent, and at times unusual in a good way, example of Macallan. One which feels ready now and would probably not benefit from too much further ageing.

Whisky-Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Few whiskies evoke the same level of reverence and intrigue as those produced at the Ben Nevis Distillery during the mid to late 1990s. This particular cask, distilled in 1996, stands as a testament to this golden era, embodying the essence of this legendary distillery in its every drop. Nose: An initial rich and deep, honeyed aroma with notes of Tarte aux Pommes gives way to enticing tropical fruit. A thickening emulsion of mango, pineapple, apricot, Guadeloupe melon and passion fruit with soft baking spices and musky florality waiting in the wings. Still, brightness leaps from the glass. Palate: Fruit and spices reveal themselves with tinned pineapple juice, fruit salad and elderflower cordial, cinnamon buns and a warming cracked black pepper note which thoroughly qualifies this spirit as “Ben Nevis ’96”. Moreover, the distinctive viscosity of the make, whose luxurious oiliness and thick tropical fruit are bolstered by a spirity inflection of pear drops and frangipane, overwhelming evidence of its provenance. Finish: A long, engaging perambulation emerging from tropical fruit chews, through a field of summer heather to a specialist panettone bakery. Comments: An excellent example of a sought-after vintage of Ben Nevis that could be enjoyed both imminently with its fruitier animated fruits bathed in its luxurious mouthfeel or, equally, left to absorb more of the deeper spicy notes held within the cask for another year or two.

Impressively fragrant and floral, with more of these notes of linen, bath salts and fabric softener. Background hints of lemon peel, gravel and menthol cigarettes. Quite a lot of cereal qualities as well. Palate: Very taught, chiselled and pure in style. Brittle minerality, toasted cereals and seeds, some brake fluid, light medicines and more chalky notes. A more typical, perhaps ‘classical Tobermory’ example but in a good way. Perhaps more idiosyncratic and characterful than cask 5015. More lemony and yeasty notes. Lots of hay and grasses as well. Finish: Long, ashy, mineral, brittle, flinty and slightly saline. A slightly chemical aspect as well but in a good, characterful way. Comments: The cask here is quieter and the distillate louder.

Develops on grassy aromas of hay and honeysuckle, then overripe apple peel and high-quality milk chocolate. The oak appears late: hardwoods and furniture polish, a hint of cinnamon. Further time in the glass reveals custard, porridge, clove and orange peel. Water lifts nougat and Playdoh aromas. Palate: Medium-full on the palate. Peppery at first, with the oak and nice touches of sugared almonds and apricot jelly, then zesty orange peel, strawberry liquorice, Playdoh, cloves, sponge cake with damson jam, cranachan, marmalade and a pleasing leafy herbaceousness towards the end. Gets fruitier with water, which also lifts wool and nougat flavours. Finish: Very good length, warm and drying. The herby notes linger with the pepper, syrup, Playdoh, a menthol note and a touch of hot spices. Comments: A very sippable dram in the old school style, with a lot of different layers of flavour held together by strong but not overbearing oak. The balance is improved further with a few drops of water.

An initial flourish of Fruit and spice in waves, Black pepper and melon, anise and orange peel acts as an overcoat to earthy smoke and vanilla, stewed plum with cinnamon buns and pan au chocolate. Notes from the bakery keep coming with crusty loaves and sour dough wafting for an age. Palate:  A thick and coating mouthfeel followed once again with big notes of fruit and spice, grapefruit and cinnamon, pineapple and clove, melon and nutmeg surrounded in a light fruity foggy smoke. Maybe a touch of roasted fennel and honey with sharp lime citrus sprits in dark chocolate keep the palate alive and fizzing wonderfully. Finish:  Long and mellowing with the lime dissipating into warm  panettone and barley sugar, I light fog of baking spice and smoke that lingers for an age. Comments: This is a spectacular example of 2007 Peated Bruichladdich, the luxurious mouth feel and balance of fruit and spice is as perfect as anyone could reasonably wish for in the make. It also offers the flexibility of further aging should the purchaser have more of a spicey preference in the final delivery.

Nose: Clean, buttery and rich. Lightly spiced with cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. A creamy vanilla note that leads to creme brulee, white pepper and eventually yellow plums and ripe garden fruits such as apples and gooseberries. A light biscuity sweetness in the background. Palate: Surprisingly powerful on arrival. Excellent weight, strength and texture. Vividly peppery, warming and spicy again. Dried fruits this time with sultanas, banana chips, apricots and lemon peel. There’s also a light, autolytic stodgy quality that alludes to scone mix and sourdough. Finish: Long, slightly yeasty, lemony, leathery and still with rather a lot of dried fruits and eventually hints of green tea, coconut and chamomile in the aftertaste. Conclusions: A top-notch, perfectly mature and well-balanced cask of Tobermory that feels at times more like an older Speyside whisky than an islander.

Nose: As with many of these mid-late 1990s Ben Nevis which are currently reaching the market, this one possesses a typical richness. At first it is dominated by honey and freshly baked bread aromas. Indeed, there is a pronounced autolytic character. The profile develops with further notes of mead and some gentle background fruitiness; white stone fruits; mirabelle; pear eau de vie. Some gingerbread is also present. Globally it is fresh, rich and with a sense of elegance and complexity. Palate: Here the Ben Nevis personality really strikes deep. Dense exotic and green fruits which are both syrupy and oily in texture. Barley sugar, quince, lemon curd and a turmeric/earthy quality. This really is excellent whisky. It is reminiscent of some of these late 1980s aged Irish single malts which have been bottled extensively these past few years. Underneath there are various tertiary complexities such as toasted seeds, yellow flowers and lanolin. An excellent Ben Nevis. Finish: Long, heathery, spicy, lightly fruity, oily and with a sense of fragrant, herbal waxiness. Comments: An excellent example of Ben Nevis at its peak. The sort of cask you could easily bottle now but should also continue to hold its quality or improve for a further 3-6 years.

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Ben Nevis cask 1459 Colour: Gold Nose: Aromatically similar to its sister cask although 1459 moves more in the direction of syrupy sweetness; golden syrup, icing sugar, treacle, coconut - even a touch of rancio. There is a more plain, straightforward earthiness as well, and some denser, darker fruits such as sultanas and prunes. Globally though this is a similarly fat, characterful and aromatically rich style. Palate: Heather ale, fragrant waxes, soot, green banana, ripe melon, guava and dried mango. Some pineapple chunks, toasted sunflower seeds, trail mix, damp earthen floored cellars, aged sweet wines. Again the profile is similar to the sister cask - the differences lie in the subtle, tertiary deviations in flavour. The quality overall is equal and the texture is similarly oily, syrupy and fat with these rather glistening fruit aspects. Finish: Long, more spice driven, slightly dryer, coal dust, a mineral aspect and some notes of meat and leather in the aftertaste. Comments: The same conclusion can be reached about cask 1459: this is a cask which is in top condition now but should maintain this quality - or even surpass it - over the next 3-6 years.

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Tobermory Cask #39 Colour: White Wine Nose: A fresh and surprisingly medicinal Tobermory. Lots of bandages, oatmeal, linen, ointments, sourdough and a rather taught salinity. Leans towards a mineral profile with time. Some notes of hessian, lamp oil and coal smoke emerge. Surprisingly clean and characterful. Some salty porridge notes along with lemon peel and baking soda. Very good! Palate: Chalky minerals, white stone fruits and lemon oils at first. A rather even texture and notes of olive oil, rice crackers, oatcakes, lime zest and lychee syrup. This medicinal side comes through again in the form of throat sweets and cough medicine. A soothing, mentholated quality emerges. Some hints of mouthwash, soda bread and herbal ointments. Finish: Long, lemony, yeasty, earthy and slightly brittle with these mineral notes of beach pebbles, crushed sea shells, sand and mustard powder. Rather powerful in fact, with a sustained, herbal aftertaste. Comments: A really excellent, characterful Tobermory.

Whisky-Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Nose: Islay’s Bruichladdich Distillery reopened in 2001 and few distilleries can claim to have enjoyed such a successful reintroduction to the Whisky world. Pioneering the idea of “Progressive Highland Distilling” this cask of unpeated ‘Laddie, distilled in 2003, comfortably takes its place among some of the most popular vintages of the distillery’s modern era. With a pronounced fruit driven nose pear drops and tarte du citron, topped with coconut icing and vanilla fudge blanketing luxuriously. Before porridge oats and Chantilly cream act soften to balance the aromatic experience. Slender inflections of cinnamon, ginger, milk chocolate, lime zest and panettone engage and disguise a far of sea fog. Palate: We’re going deep, with bitter and gooey dark chocolate fondant and strong dry spice from cracked black pepper, syrupy pears with lime zest give way to signature Bruichladdich “hot pebbles on a sandy beach”, undeniably indicative of the make and vintage. Coal dust, orange chews and juicy grapefruit act as binding agents and promote the promise of a lavish encore. Finish: A long and righteous memory of the nose and palate. Pears in syrup and tinned pineapples sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg, give way to salt baked seabass with a big wedge of lemon and underlying fruit salad for an age. This cask is essence of unpeated Bruichladdich, evocative of everything the distillery set out to achieve, and equally at home on the gantry of a high-end restaurant or sipping with your feet dangling off the pier at Port Charlotte at dusk.";"Originally filled: 12/05/2003";"Cask number: 132";"Distillery: Bruichladdich";NA;"Current age: 21 years old";"Cask type: Hogshead";"Original filled with: 144.7 litres of alcohol at 71.5%";"Original bulk litres: 201";"Original filled with: 144.7 litres of alcohol at 71.5%";NA;"New re-gauged bulk litres: 145";"Current cask strength 57.3%"

After last month's rather staggering success of the two 1993 Macallan casks, we're delighted to have another very interesting and desirable bonded cask of whisky up for auction. This time it's a 2004 Port Charlotte. These Port Charlottes were sold back in 2001 - 2005 for what now looks like bargain basement prices. Very few of them have sold on the secondary 'open' market before, with most of the cask sales taking place privately before now. So this should be an interesting experiment to find mature, bonded Port Charlotte's current market value. Below are the assessment of the cask's current qualities. The sample tasted was drawn from the cask's most recent gauging. Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Port Charlotte 2004. Cask 969. Bourbon. Colour: Gold Nose: Bonfire smoke, wood ash, lots of briny and dense coastal characteristics and tertiary notes of iodine, mercurochrome, TCP and ink. The medical and coastal characteristics are both powerful but in balance and the overall impression is one of good maturity and potency. This is a BIG Islay whisky. With a little breathing there are some more typical farmyard aspects which I find typify many early 2000s Port Charlottes of this age. Notes of hay, silage, some drying seaweed, old rope and kelp. There is a sense of building and increasing complexity with time and air. Palate: The arrival is quite intense and brings with it a sense of incense and smouldering wood. This quickly passes to reveal some notes of lemon oil and lemon zest, vanilla cream, smoked fish and a broad spectrum of medical complexities. There is also an underlying spiciness that adds balance to the natural sweetness of the distillate. Overall the texture is quite fat and oily, there is a 'meatiness' about it which alludes to chewing smoked mussels in brine. With water: lemon juice, sea salt, fresh oysters and more of these briny aspects mixed with a nice olive oil quality. Perhaps some herbal aspects as well, suggestions of dried rosemary and more kelp notes. With water: The farmyard aspects really come to dominate now. More earthiness, notes of bark, black olives and an eventual drift back towards medicine. Quite excellent! Impressions: This is a well-matured Port Charlotte from a clean and nicely balanced cask which has matured the distillate well without ever overshadowing or dominating the spirit. There is a strong sense of distillery identity and a natural 'charisma' about the distillate. These triumvirate Port Charlotte qualities of seashore, medicine and farmyard are all present and nicely balanced which leads to a complex, intriguing and delicious dram. This could easily be bottled now but should also continue to improve quite comfortably for at least another 3-4 years in bond. I would expect it to show particularly well at around 18 - 20 years of age.";NA;"Cask No: 969";"Distillery: Bruichladdich";"Distilled: 2004";"Age: 12 years old";"Cask Type: Fresh Bourbon Barrel";NA;NA;NA;NA;"Re-gauged July /2017-162 litres";"Strength: 53.9% ABV"

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Bruichladdich cask 1641 Colour: White wine Nose: As is common with lower natural cask strength malts, this has a superb freshness about it. A light green fruitiness, some notes of crushed nettle, bath salts, minerals and wet pebbles. Underneath, with a little breathing time, there are notes of pine needle, light cereals and parsley butter. Touches of citrus throughout. Palate: Surprisingly creamy. Vanilla foam with banana syrup, cocoanut milk, pink candy floss and strawberry wine. The greener fruit qualities you’d expect from Bruichladdich emerge with a little time. Notes of gooseberry wine, elderflower jam and some drying salty notes such as sandalwood and tea tree oil at the back. Finish: Good length. Full of lighter cereals, lemon oil, barley water and some notes of green olive and turmeric adding an earthy element in the aftertaste. Comments: An extremely fresh and drinkable Bruichladdich. Very much an afternoon kind of whisky. The lower strength does not hinder the texture or overtly enhance the tannin, rather it helps elevate the softer cereal and citrus fruit tones throughout the whisky.

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Tullibardine Cask #267 Colour: Deep amber / polished rosewood. Nose: This one feels very much about the cask at first nosing. Lots of sweetened black tea, jasmine, tea tree oils, creme de menthe, black pepper and cured meats. Thick, fatty, earthy and with plenty hessian and coal dust. There's also toasted oak, ripe banana, milk chocolate, walnuts and mixed dark fruits soaked in cognac. Quite excellent. Palate: Big, thick, resinous and sweet sherry. Lots of coco, walnuts, strawberry wine, gingerbread, lemon thyme, espresso, bovril and damp sack cloth. Some wee touches of treacle, salty old oloroso and rancio as well. It's really the sherry that does the talking with this one but it's an excellent and characterful - and most importantly clean - style of sherry so it works very well. Finish: Long, earthy, gingery, spicy and ultimately syrupy, sweet and slightly mentholated. Comments: An excellent, clean and richly flavoured sherry cask which has served this Tullibardine well.

There's lots of soft dunnage notes, wet earth, leaf mulch, moss, bracken and some earl grey tea as well. All in all rather leafy and fresh with a few notes of dried wild mushrooms, wild strawberries and a few crushed walnuts. Maybe a touch of lamp oil or camphor with time. Palate: Very chocolatey at first. Bitter dark chocolate, some smooth tannins that give a nice sense of composure and structure in the mouth. Also quite a few figs and berry fruits such as dark cherries, brambles and blackcurrants. Some herbal notes such as bay leaf and dried oregano, then cinnamon bark and a touch of quince paste. The overall feeling is one of immense softness and drinkability. However, the alcohol is still present and gives just the right amount of bite to keep everything nicely together. Finish: Good length considering the naturally low cask strength. Again this leafy and forest floor aspect sings loudest. More notes of tea - green and mint varieties this time - then a light oiliness and maybe a little more bitter chocolate. Some patisserie notes of pastry and freshly baked bread as well. Comments: This is a solid, very drinkable Arran which shows the delights of whiskies which reach naturally low cask strengths at  often surprising speeds.

With water: greener, slightly leafier, more organic with delicate notes of juniper, orange rind and bayleaf. Palate: Sharp at first, giving way to more cereal and vanilla sweetness.

Nose: Potted plants in a greenhouse. Lots of greenery, cut grass, cactus, green banana, peppery salad leaves and some rather oily, fatty green fruit notes as well. Lime cordial, gomme syrup, various fruit liqueurs and a fascinating note of mustardy vinagrette. Quite unusual, but big, oily and very inviting with this rather opulent fruitiness. Unlike many other Tullibardines. Continues with notes of gauze, oily rag, marzipan and sweetened herbal extracts. Palate: Big, fatty, spicy, sooty, herbal and rich. There's a rather impressive oiliness and aspects of crisp maltiness, lean bacon fat, turmeric, salted flat breads, muesli, sweet oatmeal and wood glue. Quite unlike most other malt whiskies of similar age. In time it goes towards cod live oil, white flowers and soft waxes. There's also a fermenting, yeasty quality about it - hints of sourdough, fizzy lemon and ink. Finish: Rather long and mouth coating. It's a big, textural, fatty style of distillate. Leaves behind notes of mixed dried herbs, wood spice, glue and strong, earthy teas. Comments: A fascinating cask. Unlike most other contemporary Tullibardines. This one shows real individuality, great texture and a beguiling fruitiness. Could easily be bottled now or left to age for at least another decade quite comfortably. A very fun style of whisky that should make for a great conversation stoker.";NA;"Cask No: 186";"Distillery: Tullibardine";"Distilled: 2005";"Age: 13 years old";"Cask Type: Bourbon Barrel";"Original Fill: Litres of Alcohol 124.6 @ 63.5% Original Bulk Litres 200 @ 63.5%";"Original Fill: Litres of Alcohol 124.6 @ 63.5% Original Bulk Litres 200 @ 63.5%";"Original Fill: Litres of Alcohol 124.6 @ 63.5% Original Bulk Litres 200 @ 63.5%";"New re-gauged: 11/09/2018 - 85.9 litres of Alcohol";"New re-gauged: 148.2 Bulk Litres Current Cask Strength: 57.7%";"New re-gauged: 148.2 Bulk Litres Current Cask Strength: 57.7%"

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes: Girvan 1990 - Cask 166871: Colour: Pale Gold. Nose: Lightly honeyed to begin, also notably fuller in style that many grains of similar age. Some notes of banana bread, sweet breakfast cereals, hessian and sunflower oil. Some slight varnish notes underneath along with shoe polish and new leather. With water: some custard, yellow plums and notes of play-dough and clay. Well balanced. Palate: Rather elegant oiliness, quite punchy with the alcohol but also a notable natural sweetness with flavours of foam sweets, sherbet and icing sugar. Touches of banana and more cooking oils. Good weight and texture to the mouthfeel. With water: more complex and buttery. Sweetened cooking oils, metal polish, fabrics and more confectionary notes. Finish: Good length, again quite full and oily with rapeseed oil, sun lotion, new leather again and more camphor touches. Comments: This is a pretty surprising grain showing unusual weight and a certain flavour profile you might ordinarily associate more with lighter malts or older style Irish Whiskeys. There is certainly a lot to recommend here and it could be bottled straight away as it is, however it would be a shame not to allow this cask to age longer as there could be really quite fascinating potential here with a further 5-10 years of maturation.

Followed by subtle notes of treacle, soft toffee, vanilla ice cream, some wood shavings and candy floss. Quite a confectionary nose this one, but cleanly and vibrantly so. Time reveals some more farmyard touches of wet hay, damp sack cloth and various oils and industrial aspects. Quite straightforwardly ‘highlands’ in style. Palate: The strength is surprisingly shy at first which is a good sign. This has pink grapefruit, foam shrimp sweets, barley sugar, red strawberry laces. A whole sweetie shop full of flavours. Red liquorice, caraway liqueur, some grassy touches perhaps hinting at a dryness peeping through. With time some nutmeg and fresh herbs emerge. Finish: Quite long and lemony with vanilla cream, some slightly salty notes like frying pancetta and touches of grass and rosewater.

Whisky Online Auctions Tasting Notes Cask 5487: Colour: Straw Nose: Remarkably polished and redolent with cereal, light tropical and green fruit and a soft peppery note. The oxidative effects at such a natural low cask strength are obvious here but very pleasant and beneficial on the nose. Develops further with notes of coal dust, camphor, pollen and a little wet gravel. Palate: Soft, understandably. Quite extractive as well with notes of green tea, lemon blossom, spice tannins, cinnamon bark and black peppercorns. Some gingery notes and a little tarry aspect. Globally very soft but with good flavours. Finish: Good length considering the strength. Meadowsweet, fruit gums, tea tree oil and lanolin. Comments: On its own this is too weak to legally be called whisky, but as a component to vat with a younger or higher abv whisky it could work extremely well.
