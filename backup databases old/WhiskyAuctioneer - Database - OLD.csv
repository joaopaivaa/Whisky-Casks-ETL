However, the historic site was re-opened in the 1960s, in part to provide jobs to what was a declining population at the time. The rebuilding of the distillery was backed by blenders Charles Mackinlay & Co, so like Bruichladdich, despite the island being covered in peat, it produced an un-peated spirit to meet the needs of their blends. This continued into the 1990s when Whyte & Mackay became its owners, although they did eventually introduce some peated malt to their distilling, launching the Jura Superstition in 2003.The following information is the result of a regauging which took place in May 2024.Bulk Litres: 131.43Strength: 57.52%Regauge Litres of Alcohol: 75.6*IMPORTANT NOTICE: The buyer of any cask which is stored at this location must have an existing account with the company that owns the warehouse.

For most of the 20th century it was self-sufficient, malting its own barley using peat from Pitsligo, giving it a unique smoky character. In fact, in 1968 it was short-listed by then-owners DCL, to convert to heavily peated production in order to make up for a shortfall on Islay caused by a drought. In an odd twist of fate, the decision was instead made to re-open Brora for the job, and close Glen Garioch down. Morrison Bowmore then spring to its rescue, restarting production in 1973. The maltings and distillery were closed down again by Beam Suntory in 1995, and only the latter resumed operations two years later, with contemporary Glen Garioch becoming an un-peated single malt.

Despite her important role within Greek mythology, Demeter remains one of the lesser-known of the Olympians, her story largely untold in popular culture. Just like Demeter’s sidelining in pop culture, women’s contributions to whisky have been vastly under-recognised. Through the Demeter Collection we want to honour the grain goddess and tell the untold stories of women in whisky, while raising much-needed funds to enable the OurWhisky Foundation to support, recognise and empower future generations of women in the industry.*IMPORTANT NOTICE: The buyer of any cask which is stored at this location must have an existing account with the company that owns the warehouse.

It became the first distillery in the S. Campbell & Son portfolio when they acquired it in 1945, and produced fillings for their popular Clan Campell and White Heather blends. Production capacity was increased to meet rising demand for its spirit in 1973, and the following year the company was bought over by Pernod-Ricard who operated it under the Campbell Distillers before merging it with Chivas Brothers, which they acquired from Seagram in 2001. The reverence for the sherry-casked A'Bunadh, launched in 1997, has greatly boosted the popularity of the distillery, and its output from all eras is increasingly sought after.The following are the results of a cask regauge in July 2023:New Bulk: 96.85 LitresStrength: 41.3%Regauged Litres of Alcohol: 40 *IMPORTANT NOTICE: The buyer of any cask which is stored at this location must have an existing account with the company that owns the warehouse.

It was built in the early 19th century and for the majority of the 20th it was owned by DCL (now Diageo). Its distinctive style made it highly prized by blenders, and little of it was spared for official distillery bottlings, or independents for that matter. The distillery was closed in 1993 during the Scotch market downturn, but was revived in 1997 by Inver House who purchased it and resumed production.

Its malt was important to many of their blends, and as a result, the first official distillery bottlings did not appear until the 1990s as part of the Flora & Fauna and Rare Malt Selection series. Diageo eventually offloaded the distillery along with the John Dewar & Sons portfolio to Barcardi, who created a well-respected permanent range for Craigellachie in 2014.

In an odd twist of fate, the decision was instead made to re-open Brora for the job, and close Glen Garioch down. Morrison Bowmore then sprang to its rescue, restarting production in 1973. The maltings and distillery were closed down again by Beam Suntory in 1995, and only the latter resumed operations two years later, with contemporary Glen Garioch becoming an un-peated single malt.

However, the historic site was re-opened in the 1960s, in part to provide jobs to what was a declining population at the time. The rebuilding of the distillery was backed by blenders Charles Mackinlay & Co, so like Bruichladdich, despite the island being covered in peat, it produced an un-peated spirit to meet the needs of their blends. This continued into the 1990s when Whyte & Mackay became its owners, although they did eventually introduce some peated malt to their distilling, launching the Jura Superstition in 2003.All relevant paperwork will accompany this purchase.

All proceeds raised by this lot will be donated to two Australian environmental charities to provide funds for those tragically affected by the recent wild fires in the country, they are the SA Bushfire Appeal and the Foundation for Rural & Regional Renewal. Please take the time to discover more about Lindores Abbey and this unique opportunity in our interactive long read.From distillery owner, Drew McKenzie Smith:""‘We have been horrified by the images of devastation coming from Australia. We have many Australian members of our Preservation Society who kindly contribute to the upkeep and conservation of our Abbey and its natural surroundings, so we feel compelled to do the same for them in their country’s time of need""Fittingly, the cask in question is a 300 Litre ex-Muscat hogshead from the De Bortoli winery of Victoria and New South Wales. Wine contributes a gross value of AUS$5.9bn to the Australian GDP, so the impact of the fires in areas where its vineyards are located (including some of those of De Bortoli) will be keenly felt in the years to come. The cask has been kindly donated by Nebb Whisky Barrels, a company that specialises in the sourcing of casks from Australia's best wineries.The winning bidder will be able to fill this cask themselves. They will travel to Lindores Abbey distillery to do so, where they will meet distillery manager, Gary Haggart, and enjoy a behind-the-scenes tour. Please note if the new owner is a UK revenue trader (business), they will need to be registered with HMRC and hold a WOWGR certificate.If they are a revenue trader outside the UK, they will need to have a Duty Representative in the UK (the Duty Rep would be registered with HMRC and there is usually an annual charge for their services). Please also note that we will provide the winning bidder's contact details to Lindores Abbey Distillery to arrange directly with them the filling of the cask and any associated administrative requirements.";"https://web-whisky-live.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/styles/uc_product_full/public/Lindores%20Cask-02.jpg?itok=0rptzbRe";"n/a";NA
